#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles and practices to the development, maintenance, and management of software systems.
    Importance in the technology industry
Efficiency and Productivity: Software engineering practices help streamline the development process, leading to faster delivery of high-quality software products.

Scalability: Well-engineered software can handle increasing loads and growing user bases without significant performance degradation.

Reliability: Systematic testing and quality assurance practices ensure that software operates reliably and consistently.

Maintainability: Good software engineering practices make it easier to modify and update software, extending its lifespan and reducing the cost of maintenance.

Collaboration: Software engineering promotes teamwork and collaboration, enabling large teams to work together effectively on complex projects.

Innovation: By providing a structured approach to problem-solving, software engineering fosters innovation and the development of cutting-edge technologies.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

The Advent of High-Level Programming Languages (1950s-1960s):

Description: Before high-level programming languages, developers wrote software in assembly language, which is tedious and error-prone. The introduction of high-level languages like FORTRAN, COBOL, and later languages like C revolutionized software development.

Impact: These languages abstracted away the complexities of machine code, making it easier for developers to write, read, and maintain code. This increased productivity and allowed for more sophisticated software to be developed.

The Development of Structured Programming (1960s-1970s):

Description: Structured programming introduced concepts such as modularity, control structures (like loops and conditionals), and subroutines/functions. Key figures like Edsger Dijkstra and Niklaus Wirth promoted these ideas.

Impact: This paradigm shift led to more organized and maintainable code, reducing errors and improving software quality. It laid the foundation for modern programming practices and methodologies.

The Rise of Agile Methodologies (1990s-2000s):

Description: Agile methodologies, such as Scrum and Extreme Programming (XP), emerged as a response to the limitations of traditional waterfall models. Agile emphasizes iterative development, collaboration, and flexibility.

Impact: Agile transformed the software development landscape by promoting a more adaptive and customer-focused approach. It enabled teams to respond to changing requirements more effectively and deliver value incrementally.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a process used by software developers to design, develop, test, and deploy software systems. It provides a structured approach to ensure high-quality software development. Here are the main phases of the SDLC:

Planning:

Explanation: This phase involves defining the project's goals, scope, and objectives. It includes feasibility studies, resource allocation, and project scheduling.

Purpose: To establish a clear roadmap for the development process and ensure that all stakeholders are aligned.

Requirements Analysis:

Explanation: In this phase, the specific requirements of the software are gathered and documented. This includes understanding the needs and expectations of stakeholders.

Purpose: To create a detailed requirements specification that serves as a foundation for the subsequent phases.

Design:

Explanation: The design phase involves creating a blueprint for the software's architecture, components, interfaces, and data flow. High-level and detailed design documents are produced.

Purpose: To plan the structure and behavior of the software to meet the specified requirements.

Implementation (Coding):

Explanation: During this phase, the actual code is written based on the design documents. Developers translate the design into functional software.

Purpose: To develop the software that fulfills the requirements and design specifications.

Testing:

Explanation: The software is rigorously tested to identify and fix any defects or issues. This includes unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and user acceptance testing.

Purpose: To ensure that the software functions correctly, meets the requirements, and is free of bugs.
Deployment:

Explanation: The software is deployed to the production environment, making it available for end-users. This phase may involve installation, configuration, and data migration.

Purpose: To deliver the software to users and ensure it is operational in the intended environment.

Maintenance:

Explanation: After deployment, the software enters the maintenance phase, where it is monitored, updated, and improved based on user feedback and changing requirements.

Purpose: To ensure the software remains functional, secure, and relevant over time.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
waterfall methodology - Linear and sequential, each phase is completed before moving on. 
- there is Low flexibility,
 changes are hard to incorporate once a phase is complete.
 - Customer feedback comes late, after the product is developed.
 - Testing is done at the end of the development process.


agile methodology - Iterative and incremental, with multiple cycles (sprints). 
- High flexibility, adapts to changing requirements. 
- Regular customer feedback is incorporated into every sprint. 
- Testing is continuous and done after each iteration.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer - developing applications,programs and systems using programming languages and frameworks.
 - maintaining and updating software to keep it functional. 
- collaborating with other team members to ensure best practice when developing software.
 - reporting to the project manager about the progress of the software development.
Quality Assurance Engineer - collaborate with stakeholders to understand and clarify software requirement.
 - create development standards and procedures for the programmers to follow
 - confirm that the software meets the requirement before deployment. 
- analyse the product to identify bugs and suggest changes to make them more efficient. 
- develop and execute automation scripts using open source tools.
Project Manager - assembles and lead the software development team.
 - discuss the project and it's requirement with the client and software developers.
 - create blueprint for the project.
 - tracking and communicating information regarding the project milestone.
 - deliver the complete software to the client and regularly check its performance.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
An integrated development environment (IDE) is a software platform that facilitates the creation of other software applications by providing a space to write, compile, and debug code, sometimes with value-adding tools that reduce development efforts. eg Visual Studio Code (VSCode)
importance:
Programming languages have rules for how statements must be structured. Because an IDE knows these rules, it contains many intelligent features for automatically writing or editing the source code.
An IDE can format the written text by automatically making some words bold or italic, or by using different font colors. These visual cues make the source code more readable and give instant feedback about accidental syntax errors.
an IDE can make suggestions to complete a code statement when the developer begins typing.
IDEs increase programmer productivity by performing repeatable development tasks that are typically part of every code change. The following are some examples of regular coding tasks that an IDE carries out.
An IDE compiles or converts the code into a simplified language that the operating system can understand. - Some programming languages implement just-in-time compiling, in which the IDE converts human-readable code into machine code from within the application.
The IDE allows developers to automate unit tests locally before the software is integrated with other developers' code and more complex integration tests are run.
Debugging IDE enables a step through the code, line by line, as it runs and inspect code behavior. IDEs also integrate several debugging tools that highlight bugs caused by human error in real time, even as the developer is typing.

Version Control Systems (VCS) - are software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time. eg Git
importance:
Collaboration: Enables multiple developers to work on the same codebase without conflicts.
Change Tracking: Records detailed history of changes, allowing easy analysis of each modification. 
-Branching and Merging: Supports creating branches for new features and merging them back into the main code.
Error Recovery: Allows reverting to previous versions if new changes introduce errors

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit tests - are close to the source of an application, They consist in testing individual methods and functions of the classes, components, or modules used by your software. - it ensures that each unit performs its intended function correctly, isolated from other components.
 Integration tests - verify that different modules or services used by your application work well together.
 - help to ensure data flows smoothly between modules and interfaces work as expected.
 System testing -Focus on the entire software system as a whole, including all functionalities and interactions.
 -It help to verify that the system meets all functional and non-functional requirements, including performance, usability, and security .
Acceptance tests - are formal tests that verify if a system satisfies business requirements. They require the entire application to be running while testing and focus on replicating user behaviors. 
- Whether the software meets the needs of the end-user and is ready for deployment.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
prompt engineering  is the process where you guide generative AI solutions to generate desired outputs.
Importance:
Improved user experience - Prompt engineering makes it easy for users to obtain relevant results in the first prompt. It helps mitigate bias that may be present from existing human bias in the large language models’ training data.
Increased flexibility - A prompt engineer can create prompts with domain-neutral instructions highlighting logical links and broad patterns.
developer control - Prompt engineering gives developers more control over users' interactions with the AI. Effective prompts provide intent and establish context to the large language models. Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise.
